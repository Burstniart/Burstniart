I'm Alejandro Garcia, a systems engineneer with knowledge in computer systems focused on the creation, deployment, configuration and maintenance of software, experience in custom software for Mainframe Systems that require fast and efficient solutions (Python, JavaScript, C, COBOL & NodeJs).

Proactive, responsible, self-directed.
Team player who loves to be involved in every aspect of the project, I'll lend a hand any time.
When I'm not working I'm learning and sharpening my skills.
