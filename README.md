I'm Alejandro Garcia, a student with knowledge in computer systems focused on the creation, deployment, configuration and maintenance of software, implementation of networks and databases, web development (Git, Python, JavaScript, NodeJs, React, Express, MySQL and Java).

Proactive, responsible, self-directed.
